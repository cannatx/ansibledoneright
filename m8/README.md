# Module 8
Combining the infrastructure as code capabilities from module 5 with
the filters and unit tests of module 4. Introduces using a GNU Makefile
to run linters, unit tests, and production operations.

## Markdown demo
Just type normally for regular text

### Some subheaders too
You can use up to 6 hash symbols for subheaders

###### See? Not that hard
`single line monospace uses single backticks`

```
but you can also
do a multiline block
with triple backticks
```

*Itatic* uses single asterisks or single underscores
**Bold** uses double asterisks or double underscores

> You can make a "note" using the greater than symbol

Numbered lists just use digits followed by periods
  1. Remember to put a few spaces before the number
  2. It's pretty easy

Bullet lists are similar but can use asterisks or hyphens
  * I prefer asterisks though
  * Just be consistent with your symbol usage
    * Use two spaces to indent sublists
    * Much easier than writing HTML
